public class Tent
{

  //I added this class in case you needed more of an inheritance hierarchy for the tents, but maybe you could use only one tent class and change the attributes
  //depending on how differents each tents are.

  //If inheritances is not needed, you should delete Tent_1, Tent_2 and Tent_3 and work here, in case its needed, you should put the global attributes here
  //and then the specific ones in Tent_1, Tent_2 and Tent_3
